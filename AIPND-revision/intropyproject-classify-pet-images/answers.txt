Q1:  Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

A1:  Yes, they all reported the breed to be a doberman, doberman pinscher.


Q2:  Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

A2:  Both alexnet and vgg architecture models reported the same breed of doberman, doberman pinscher for Dog_01.jpg and Dog_02.jpg. However, resnet reported that the breed for Dog_01.jpg is doberman, doberman pinscher while the breed for Dog_02.jpg is redbone.


Q3:  Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

A3:  Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs.


Q4:  Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

A4:  The model architecture that did the best at classifying the four uploaded images was alexnet. This is because it correctly classified both dog and non-dog photos; the label and classifier labels matched, despite being the wrong breed (all three architectures got the breed wrong, but resnet couldn't correctly match both labels and vgg required 2 additional seconds to compute its results), and it only took 1 second to compute these results (resnet only took 1 second as well, but its pet label and classifier label were different).
